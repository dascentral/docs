# Packages

## First-Party

Laravel provides several first-party packages of significant quality. The following are worth noting.

### Laravel Envoy

[Laravel Envoy](https://github.com/laravel/envoy) is a tool for executing common tasks you run on your remote servers. Using [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/blade) style syntax, you can easily setup tasks for deployment, Artisan commands, and more.

### Laravel Nova

[Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com/) is a beautifully designed administration panel for Laravel. Carefully crafted by the creators of Laravel, Nova is designed to make you the most productive developer in the galaxy.
