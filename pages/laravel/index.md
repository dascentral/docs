# Introduction

[Laravel](http://laravel.com/) is a free, open-source PHP web framework created by [Taylor Otwell](https://twitter.com/taylorotwell) intended for developing web applications that follow the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

I discovered the framework in 2014 and immediately loved its power and simplicity. It quickly became the foundation of my preferred tech stack for any web development project. It remains a joy to work with today.
