# ESLint

ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It was created by Nicholas C. Zakas in 2013. Rules in ESLint are configurable, and customized rules can be defined and loaded. ESLint covers both code quality and coding style issues. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESLint).

## Configuring ESLint

I have struggled with how to properly configure ESLint for years. It's a nugget of knowledge that has eluded me. Here are resources I've assemble to assist with the learning process.
